# Hello World
My name is **Harkirat Dhillon** and I am a student at Southern Alberta Insitute of Technology (SAIT) in the Graphic Design course for the School for Advanced Digital Technology.
I have just started being at SAIT and I am still learning all there is to do at SAIT. 
## What I Like to Do
Whenever I have free time on my hands I tend to do activities that will relax me, such as:
- Working out at the gym or at home
- Biking around my neighbourhood
- Sketching ideas for designs and/or logos
- playing video games
  - Action Adventure
  - RPG
